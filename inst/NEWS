ExCluster Version 0.99 submission to bioconductor!

- ExCluster package now passes R CMD build and check, and BiocCheck!
- takes about 2-3 hours to run on large datasets
- added a "Toy Dataset" for function manual runnable examples within the package
- more code in ExCluster has been turned into functions to reduce repeated code
- still some repeated code (such as parsing EnsIDs and exon bins)
