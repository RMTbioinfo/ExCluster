Changes in Version 0.99.0
- ExCluster package now passes R CMD build and check, and BiocCheck!
- takes about 2-3 hours to run on large datasets
- added a "Toy Dataset" for function manual runnable examples within the package
- more code in ExCluster has been turned into functions to reduce repeated code
- still some repeated code (such as parsing EnsIDs and exon bins)

Changes in Version 0.99.1
- Removed extraneous files causing errors in the build

Changes in Version 0.99.2
- Reformatted the Vignette & DESCRIPTION to process the Vignette correctly with Sweave

Changes in Version 0.99.3

Changes in Version 0.99.5
- Fixed incorrectly pushed changes, which caused build error

Changes in Version 0.99.6
- Completely re-wrote the GFF_convert() function to have helper functions and take advantage of GenomicRanges
- Changed processCounts, which was incorrectly counting reads as stranded (is now set to unstranded)
- Altered ExCluster null hypothesis simulations to run faster (about 4 times faster now)
- Made numerous small changes to address the issues with first Bioconductor review

Changes in Version 0.99.7
- Fixed a number of bugs resulting from ExCluster() function code changes
- Updated the Vignette to correctly reflect changes suggested from the Bioconductor review
